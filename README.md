# asciify
Program to produce an ascii form of a given image.

## What is it?
The program outputs an ascii character form of a given .jpg or .png image.
A personal project to gain insight as to how ascii art is produced,
and to be able to create ascii art forms of any given image.
Currently still a work-in-progress, with a GUI hopefully coming soon, 
and additional features.

## How does it work?
This is a python program that uses the Python Image Library to turn the 
pixels into more useful RGB data. It then uses the data to determine 
which characters best correspond to each pixel, and outputs the mapped result.

## Motive 
The intent of this project was to, as previously stated, learn about how these things
that pop up on the internet every now and then are even created, and to be able to create them.
It also helped to understand more about image processing for future projects.
